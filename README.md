# Sound therapy and virtual therapist
A therapy application that implements sound therapy, music therapy and a virtual therapist (chatbot)


NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. MORE FEATURES ARE TO BE ADDED SOON. All assets and packages used here are solely for educational purposes.

This is my final year project I did by myself and 2 other teammates. We wanted to create something that makes a significant change in the health and well being of teens and young adults. This project is heavily insipired from headspace application and the pros of sound and music therapy. Please do bear in mind that this project is buiilt under a small time window and under COVID restrictions.


Our aim in this project is to make therapy more accessible to users. It is also build with the intent of a medical professional monitoring it to treat multiple patients

Our project is completely built in Python 3.X and consists of 3 modules.

        1.  Personality Survey
        2.  Sound/Music Therapy
        3.  Virtual Therapist (Charbot)

1. **Personality Survey:** This survey was heavily inspired from Myers-Briggs test and built in a similar way. The code consists of 25 questions (more to be added/enhanced) which is used to determine the mood of the user. Answers given by the user will be stored in the datbade (TBA). The rest of the appliications functions based on the inputs given by the user.
2. **Sound/Music Therapy:** Based on the inputs given in the personality survey, a library of audio files which consists of binaural beats/rainfall/resonance sounds are played tpo soothe the user and release their stress.
3. **Virtual Therapist:** In certain cases where the user mmight need a companion, then the virtual therapist comes into action. This bot will help as a leaning shoulder and listen to the user's problems. It also helps in identiifying the problem and explaining it to the user.
